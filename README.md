# National Cyber League

## Objective

The NCL hackathon competition was designed for beginners to test their abilities in a vaeriety of cybersecurity categories. Password cracking, web application exploit, forensics, and open source intelligence are examples of different fields players were able to achieve points on. This competition gave players a hands-on experience as to how some of these problems would be solved in the real world.

### Skills Learned

- Heightened usage of web browsers and finding information through open source
- Extracted plaintext from encypted and obfuscated messages
- Identifying different types of password hashing

### Tools Used

- Web browsers
- Cyberchef
- Chrome developer tools

## Outcome

My first competition, the NCL Hackathon, was a pivotal point in my learning journey. It introduced me to real-world applications of cybersecurity across various domains and allowed me to familiarize myself with different concepts. At the time, I didnâ€™t have access to a computer powerful enough to run a terminal or Linux, so I focused on areas like OSINT and cryptography using web-based tools and applications. Despite these limitations, I gained valuable experience that continues to apply to the concepts I'm learning today. I plan to participate in the competition again, now with a more capable PC, and aim to score in the top 500.
